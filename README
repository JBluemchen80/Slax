Linux Live Kit Improved.
This set of scripts will help you to 
build your own Live Kit distro. This project is based on 
the original Linux Live Kit. <http://linux-live.org>

Some information you want to know:
+ Store Linux Live Kit in a directory which is not going to be included
  in your live distro, else it would be copied to it. 
  The best practice is to make a directory such 
  as for example: '/tmp/a', and put all the files there.

  NOTE:
    Make sure to extract and use it on a POSIX-compatible filesystem,
    since it will create symlinks and such.
    
+ Before you start building your Kit, edit the ./.config file
  Most importantly change the LIVEKITNAME variable.

+ Make sure you are pointing to the right kernel. If in doubt, change the path in ./.config
  Your kernel must support squashfs and aufs, or else you will get an error 
  both while building, and when you actually boot the Live Kit.
  
  PROTIP:
    Debian Jessie's kernel has both supported out-of-the-box.
    You might consider using Debian Jessie as a base, but it's not required.

+ You may also wish to replace boot background in ./bootfiles/bootlogo.png
  and edit and/or tweak syslinux.cfg to fit your needs. 
  
  NOTE:
    When editing the configuration file, make sure to keep all paths 
    pointing to /boot/, since it will be replaced to /LIVEKITNAME/boot/ 
    during the build session.

+ Linux Live Kit comes with precompiled static binaries in ./initramfs
  directory. Those may be outdated but will work. You may replace them
  by your own statically linked binaries, if you know how to compile them.

+ If you want to boot your Live Kit from a CD, you need to recompile
  syslinux.bin/isolinux.bin else it won't be able to boot your Live Kit 
  from directory "/LIVEKITNAME". There is a script prepared for you which 
  will handle all of the building. Simply go to directory ./tools/ and run 
  update-isolinux.bin, it will rebuild ./bootfiles/isolinux.bin automatically 
  by downloading SysLinux sources, patching them using your actual LIVEKITNAME and
  recompiling. This step is not needed if you plan only need the ZIP archive version.

+ If you have tmpfs mounted on /tmp, make sure you have enough (or maybe even 
  a lot of) RAM, since Live Kit will store lots of data to the target. 
  If you don't have enough (or even went out of) RAM, make sure 
  that /tmp is a regular on-disk directory.

+ You will need to have the following packages installed:
  - squashfs-tools
  - genisoimage and/or mkisofs
  - zip

When you're ready run the ./build script to create your Live Kit.
  The script will:
  - Build both ISO and ZIP files for you in /tmp
  - Do all the hard work for you.
  - Will automatically check for errors. 
  - Will warn you if you don't have the correct packages.
