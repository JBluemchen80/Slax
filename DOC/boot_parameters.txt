Boot parameters
=====================================================
These are used by the bootloader, the kernel and 
the Live Kit system itself.

You can pass these boot parameters to the bootloader:

Live Kit parameters:
 >  debug    - Start the Live Kit in debugging mode.
 >  from={n} - Load data from {n}. (will search all devices for the data)
 >  copy2ram - Boot the Live Kit system just as normal, but also copy data to RAM.
 >  perch    - Activate persistent changes.

Kernel parameters:
 >  noapic   - Disable APIC (if you want, or maybe if your kernel screams about it!)
 >  acpi=off - Disable ACPI (if you might be still using a legacy system :P)
 >  init={n} - Execute command {n} instead of the init script itself.
