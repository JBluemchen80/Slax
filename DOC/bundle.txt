Bundles
======================================

A bundle is compressed squashfs filesystem, consisting of up-to-the-root
directory structure. The older, but still functional predecessor of the bundle 
is called a 'module'. The bundle is an improved version of the 'module'.

How to make a bundle:
    # mksquashfs bundle_rootfs wholefs.{bext} -comp xz -b 1024k

    or
    # mksquashfs /usr /usr.{bext} --keep-as-directory -comp xz -b 1024k

    or use function in livekitlib:
    # . livekitlib; mkbund bundle_rootfs wholefs.{bext}
