Linux Live Kit Improved
=========================================================

+ This toolkit is based on 
  the original Linux Live Kit. (http://linux-live.org/)

Extracted from the original terminology.txt:
> also known as Linux Live Kit. Formely known as Linux Live CD. Nowadays,
>  people mostly use USB flash drives, cameras, and other devices to run
>  such 'Live' linuxes, thus Live CD is no longer ideal name for it.

> Meaning of Kit is like a tool, toolkit, or such. Which (I believe) corresponds
> with the usage of such Live Linux distribution much better.


Bundles
=========================================================

+ a bundle is a compressed SquashFS archive/image 
  used to expand the system. It makes the system pretty much modular.

Read ./bundle.txt to learn more about bundles.
